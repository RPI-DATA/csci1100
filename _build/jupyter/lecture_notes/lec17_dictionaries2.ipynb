    "1. Create a dictionary to store the favorite colors of the following\n",

    "  - Thomas prefers red  \n",
    "  - Ashok prefs green  \n",
    "  - Sandy prefers red  \n",

    "  - Fei prefers green  \n",

    "  Then add some others of your own. Now, write code to change Fei’s\n",
    "  preference to green and to remove Sandy’s preference from the\n",
    "  dictionary.  \n",
    "1. Using the dictionary from the first problem, write code to find which\n",
    "  color is most commonly preferred. Use a second dictionary, one that\n",
    "  associates strings (representing the colors) with the counts. Output\n",
    "  the most common color. If there are ties, output all tied colors.  \n",
    "1. Complete the fast, list solution to the movie counting problem based\n",
    "  on sorting, as outlined at the start of the lecture notes.  \n",
    "1. Write a program that uses a dictionary that associates integers\n",
    "  (the key) and sets strings (the values) to find the number of\n",
    "  movies in each year of the IMDB. Start from any of the IMDB examples.\n",
    "  Write additional code\n",
    "  that uses the `years_and_movies` dictionary to find the year that\n",
    "  has the most movies.  \n",
    "1. Use a dictionary to determine which last names are most common in the\n",
    "  IMDB data we have provided. Count individual people not the movies\n",
    "  they appear in. For example, `'Hanks, Tom'` counts as one instance\n",
    "  of the name `'Hanks\"` despite the fact that he is in many movies.\n",
    "  Assume that the last name ends with the first `','` in the actual\n",
    "  name. Start this problem by thinking about what the dictionary keys\n",
    "  and values should be.  \n",
    "1. Which two individuals have the most movies in common? To solve this\n",
    "  you will need to start from the dictionary that associates each\n",
    "  individual with the set of movies s/he is involved in. Then you will\n",
    "  need double for loops.  At first glance this appears that it might\n",
    "  be very, very slow, but it can be made much faster by intelligently\n",
