    "## Differences between Python and C++\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few first things to notice between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "- C++ is a compiled statically typed language. This means that\n",
    "  variables need to be defined with a data type first, and the data\n",
    "  type cannot be changed.  \n",
    "- Programs cannot be run until compiled. If you have a syntax error,\n",
    "  the compiler will not produce an executable until you resolve all\n",
    "  syntax errors.  \n",
    "- In C++, many new errors will be checked at compile time, like trying\n",
    "  to add a string and an integer. As Python is dynamically typed, you\n",
    "  are used to resolving such errors at run time. This means, you will\n",
    "  spend more of your time in fixing compilation errors in C++ than in\n",
    "  Python. Hence, learn to write programs in small steps, test and\n",
    "  expand.  \n",
    "- Syntax differences: each line in a program must end with a semicolon\n",
    "  and each block must be delimited by curly brackets.  \n",
    "- Be aware of the scope of local/global variables. Generally using our\n",
    "  convention of passing variables to functions only as arguments and\n",
    "  returning the result will help you a lot.  \n",
    "- Strings and a single character are the same type of object in\n",
    "  Python, but not in C++. Overall, make sure you understand each data\n",
    "  type well first. Start with simple data types before you go into\n",
    "  containers.  \n",
    "- Many basic programming constructs are similar: variables, data\n",
    "  types, operations, operator precedence, functions, loops, files,\n",
    "  etc. You will find that for loops generally involve a single integer\n",
    "  counter, no range function. Learn the basic snytax for these first.  \n",
    "- Containers will be different. Instead of lists in Python that can be\n",
    "  used for everything, you will need to learn about arrays, lists and\n",
    "  vectors in C++. All containers we used had flexible length, while in\n",
    "  C++, some will have predefined size.  \n",
    "- You will see classes in C++ are very similar, but have a few new\n",
    "  limitations like private attributes that can only be used within the\n",
    "  class. This is actually a good thing, believe me.  \n",
