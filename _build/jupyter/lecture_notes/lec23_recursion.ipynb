    "- Python then makes the function call, switching execution to the start\n",
    "  of the called function.  \n",
    "- This function in turn can make additional (potentially recursive)\n",
    "  function calls, adding information to the top of the stack each time.  \n",
    "- When a function ends, Python looks at the top of the stack, and  \n",
    "  - restores the values of the local variables and parameters of the\n",
    "    most recent calling function,  \n",
    "  - removes this information from the top of the stack,  \n",
    "  - inserts the returned value of the called function (if any) in the\n",
    "    appropriate location of the calling function’s code, and  \n",
