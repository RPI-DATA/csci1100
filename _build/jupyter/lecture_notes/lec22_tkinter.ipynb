    "\n",
    "- A graphical user interface is designed to do something in response\n",
    "  to an event.  \n",
    "- Example events are:  \n",
    "  - Button push (most popular so far)  \n",
    "  - Selection from a list of options  \n",
    "  - Mouse movement  \n",
    "- The interface usually runs within a main window (often called\n",
    "  root) and listens continuously for events it knows how to process.  \n",
    "  - Hence, a GUI is always in an infinite loop.  \n",
    "  - When an event happens, it executes the function corresponding to\n",
    "    the event and continues to listen.  \n",
    "  - To finish the GUI loop, often an explicit termination command\n",
    "    has to happen.  \n",
    "- TkInter is a Python module implementing the Tk toolkit for building\n",
    "  graphical user interfaces. Other languages also have Tk\n",
    "  implementations.  \n",
    "- **Note:** The most important distinction between regular and event\n",
    "  based programming is that the action corresponding to an event gets\n",
    "  executed in parallel with the rest of the program, it does not\n",
    "  block the execution of functions in response to other events.  "
