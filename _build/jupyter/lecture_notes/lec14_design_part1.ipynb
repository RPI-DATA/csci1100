    "  - Choice of container/data structure; choice of algorithm.  \n",
    "    - At the moment, we don’t know too many containers, but we will\n",
    "      think about different ways to use the one container - lists -\n",

    "  times each value occurs?  \n",

    "  - Example: ocean temperature measurements, pixel intensities, income\n",
