Lecture 19 --- Exercises
========================

Solutions to the problems below must be sent to Submitty for
automatic scoring.  A separate file must submitted for each problem.
Solutions must be submitted by 4 pm on Friday, April 7.


#. The ``Restaurant.py`` file you were provided includes a main code
   area with code to test functions that have not yet been written
   (see the methods with ``pass`` as their only statements). These
   are the ``min_review``, the ``max_review``, the ``latitude`` and
   the ``longitude``.  Please implement these functions, test them, and
   submit the resulting ``Restaurant.py``.

#. Copy the code in ``lec19_restaurant_exercise.py`` into a file
   called ``lec19_american_in_troy.py``.  Rewrite the main code in
   this new file to list the names of all Restaurants in 
   *Troy* that have *American* in their category and that have an average
   rating of **more than** 3.0.  The **only output** should be the alphabetical
   list of restaurant names, one per line of 
   output.  The trick is that you are *not allowed to change* the
   ``Restaurant`` class at all.  This will require that you
   access and use both one or two methods from ``Restaurant`` and some
   of its attributes directly.  Upload your
   ``lec19_american_in_troy.py`` to Submitty when you are done.
   Submitty will use our ``Restaurant.py`` file to test.
