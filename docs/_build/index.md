##  Course  Description 
--- 
This  course  is  an  introduction  to  computer  science  emphasizing  computational  thinking,  problem-solving,  small-scale  programming,  and  applications.  This  includes  basic  programming  constructs  such  as  data,  variables,  functions,  conditionals,  loops,  lists,  files,  sets  and  dictionaries.  It  also  includes,  especially  in  the  latter  part  of  the  semester,  object-oriented  programming  and  problem  solving.  Applications  will  include  web-centric  computing,  image  processing,  numerical  computing,  and  graphics.  Previous  programming  experience  is  neither  required  nor  expected.
