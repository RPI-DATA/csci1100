# Lecture 2 - Exercises



## Overview

These problems are exercises to work on at the end of lecture and
submit for a small part of your grade.  Normally, solutions will be
due within 24 hours of the end of the lecture they are associated
with.  For these Lecture 2 exercises only, they will be due by the end
of Lab 1 so that any problems with submission can be ironed out.

Students are welcome to work on these problems in small groups, but
each student should write the final version of their solutions
independently.  Each student must submit their own solutions.



## Getting Started with the Wing IDE

Open up the Wing IDE:

- You can practice with small sections of Python code by typing in the
  interpreter in the lower right pane.  
- In order to create a Python program that you save to a file, click
  *File -> New*.  You can save it to a file by typing *File -> Save
  As*  
- As discussed in Lab 0 you should save your programs in an organized
  manner within your Dropbox folder.  
- Once you have drafted your code to solve a problem or, better yet,
  have written enough that you are ready to experiment with what you
  have, click on the green triangle to run your code.  You will see
  the results in the interpreter pane on the lower right.  
- If you do not see the green triangle, you need to save your code
  to a file first.  


Now you are ready to proceed...



## Problems for Grade Submission

1. Write a single line of Python code that converts the temperature
  64 from Celsius to Fahrenheit and prints the value.  Submit a Python
  file containing just this single line of code.  The output should
  just be the number that your code produces.  Your code must include
  the use of an expression involving multiplication and a `print`
  function call.  
1. Write Python code that creates three variables called
  `length`, `width` and `height` to store the dimensions of a 16.5 x
  12.5 x 5 box.  Write additional code that calculates the volume
  of the box and calculates its surface area, storing each in a
  variable.  Print the values of these variables.  Your code must use
  five assignment statements and two print function calls.  Submit a
  file containing these seven lines of Python code. Your output
  should be  



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
volume = 1031.25
area = 702.5

```
</div>

</div>



1. Your problem is to determine the output of the Python program shown
  below.  You must submit a text file showing the output.  (Hint:
  there should be two lines with one integer on each line.)  While it
  is possible to just run the program and copy the output, we
  *strongly* encourage you to not do this.  You need to develop
  the ability to read code and understand what it will do.  You will
  be tested on it.  



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
z = 2
z = z**2**3
print(z)
x = 6
x = x**2 + 6 - z // 10 * 2
print(x)

```
</div>

</div>
